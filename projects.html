                    <h1>Goals</h1>
                    <p class="inner-text">This is a project about the use of artificial intelligence for guitar education. Specifically, I compared two machine vision mechanisms (YOLO and MediaPipe) to see which would perform better for the task of visual guitar chord classification. This technology could be very useful in helping amateur guitarists learn how to play basic chords.</p>

                    <h1>Methods and Results</h1>
                    <p class="inner-text">I collected a dataset consisting of images of volunteers playing a series of basic guitar chords (A, C, D, Em, G), and used those to train YOLO and MediaPipe models with Google Colaboratory. I then used various statistics and graphs to compare the two, and to determine that YOLO outperformed MediaPipe for this specific task.</p>

                    <h1>Awards</h1>
                    <p class="inner-text">As a member of my high school's science research program, I presented this research several times throughout high school. At the 2025 Westchester Science and Engineering Fair (WESEF), I earned two awards: First Place in Computer Science Research, and Excellence in Computer Science and Mathematics. At the 2023 Somers Science Fair, I won Second Place in Computer Science Research.</p>

                    <h1>FIRST Robotics</h1>
                    <p class="inner-text">FIRST is an organization that hosts international robotics competitions every year, mainly for high school students. I participated in my high school's FIRST Robotics Competition team for four years, including two years as the Captain of Computer Engineering. During my two years as captain, I was the only programmer on the team, and gained significant experience in robotics programming.</p>

                    <h1>Swerve Drive</h1>
                    <p class="inner-text">Of the many drivetrains commonly used in FIRST Robotics Competitions, swerve is one of the most versatile and the most complex. During my senior year, my team attempted to build a swerve drive system for the very first time, despite our lack of experience. As the sole programmer, I learned how to program a swerve drive system and prepared one for the team, with the help of online tutorials and supportive programmers from other FIRST teams.</p>

                    <h1>Video Tutorials</h1>
                    <p class="inner-text">To be frank, programming a swerve drive system was not an easy  or simple task. I graduated the following year, and I wanted to do everything in my power to make the task of programming a swerve drive system as easy as possible for the captains that would come after me. Thus, I created a seven-part series of video tutorials to explain everything that I know in-depth and in an easy-to-understand manner, in the hopes that it would help someone.</p>

                    <p class="inner-text">This website was my first foray into front-end development, or any kind of web design for that manner. I had been teaching myself the languages of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript prior to building this website, but I hadn't used them in any meaningful capacity yet. This website is an opportunity for me to practive and demonstrate the web design skills I'd been building.</p>

                    <h1>Programming</h1>
                    <p class="inner-text">As can be seen in the GitHub repository, this website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, all written entirely by myself. Online resources were used in this website's creation, but notably, generative artificial intelligence was not used in any capacity. I programmed this website on my own over the course of four weeks as a graduating high school senior to demonstrate my newfound web design abilities.</p>

                    <h1>Looking Ahead</h1>
                    <p class="inner-text">This was only my first attempt at genuine web design, and I aim to continue practicing and honing my skills through my college years and beyond. I expect to learn much more about web design as a computer science major in college, and I will use those skills in and outside of this website as I grow.</p>
